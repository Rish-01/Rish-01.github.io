# About Me

I am currently an intern at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) under Professor Punit Rathore.

## Background

I find immense joy in the world of Machine Learning, as it beautifully combines my love for mathematics and technology. The idea of reasoning through first principles resonates with me, and it's this approach that drives my enthusiasm for research.

## Personal Pursuits

Outside of my professional endeavors, I dedicate my free time to reading and implementing research papers. This not only keeps me updated with the latest trends but also allows me to continuously learn and grow. 

Also, in my free time, I'm actively engaging with MIT OpenCourseWare, enriching my knowledge in key areas:

- **6.041 - Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability:** Currently exploring the fundamentals of probability.

- **18.06 - Linear Algebra:** Strengthening my foundation in linear algebra.

These courses not only contribute to my academic growth but also align with my passion for applying theoretical concepts to real-world problem-solving.
